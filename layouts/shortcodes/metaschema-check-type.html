<p>Setting this keyword to a value that is not a {{ .Get 0 }} results in a schema that
is not considered valid. You can catch these mistakes by validating a schema
against its meta-schema using the <a href="https://github.com/sourcemeta/jsonschema/blob/main/docs/metaschema.markdown"><code>jsonschema metaschema</code></a> command.  For example:</p>

<pre class="highlight">
$ jsonschema metaschema my-schema.json
</pre>
